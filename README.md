# Python-Basics-Sorting
## This repository contains Python implementations of common sorting algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental for understanding data structures and algorithms and are often used in software development and competitive programming.

# Sorting Algorithms Included:
## 1. Selection Sort 
### Description: It works by repeatedly finding the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element. 
### Complexity: O(n^2), Best-case: O(n^2)

## 2. Bubble Sort
### Description: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.
### Complexity: Worst-case: O(n^2), Best-case: O(n) (when already sorted, with optimization)

## 3. Insertion Sort
### Description: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted portion.
### Complexity: Worst-case: O(n^2) Best-case: O(n) (when already sorted)
